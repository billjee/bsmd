# Blockchain for smart mobility
Blockchain framework for Smart Mobility Data-market (BSMD) is designed to solve the privacy, security and management issues related to the sharing of passively as well as actively solicited large-scale data. Data from the individuals, governments, universities and companies are distributed on the network and stored in a decentralized manner, the data transactions are recorded and must have the authorization of the owners.

For building the experiment of the BSMD we use the [Hyperleadger indys-sdk](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk).

## Instalation
In order tu run the transaction example and the experiments, first you need to install a test network

1. Install network in different computers follow [this guide](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/start-nodes.md#create-a-network-and-start-nodes) (hard)
2. Install network in a single computer follow [this guide](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk#how-to-start-local-nodes-pool-with-docker) (easy)
3. Got to [transaction](/transaction) to see a transaction example or go to [experiments](/experiments) to run some stress test.
