# Blockchain for smart mobility
Blockchain framework for Smart Mobility Data-market (BSMD) is designed to solve the privacy, security and management issues related to the sharing of passively as well as actively solicited large-scale data. Data from the individuals, governments, universities and companies are distributed on the network and stored in a decentralized manner, the data transactions are recorded and must have the authorization of the owners.

For building the simulations and examples of the BSMD we use the [Hyperledger indy-sdk](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk) and [Hyperledger indy-node](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node).

## Contents
1. In the [examples](/examples) folder are samples of cybersecurity, privacy impacts and transactions. In each subfolder are instructions for running the examples 
2. In the [experiments](/experiments) folder are the simulations. In each subfolder are instructions for running the simulations
